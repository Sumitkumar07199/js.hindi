#To improve security performance of code, reuseiability development of code.
#Methodology of code.
#Oops is amethodology and techniques to devloped real thinking implementation in programming is called oops(object oriented programming system).

#Question: Why we use OOPS:
#Performance based, Attructured programming object base (reference)programming,dynamic programming.
# OOPS components:
# 1-class
# 2-Methods
# 3-Attributes(variables)
# 4-Objects

# 1-Class:
# Class is a blueprint and prototype we can declare all data member. Function inside in a class.
    
# 2-Method:
# Method is a member of your class. Methods are usefull to perform a logic of in your class.locals

# 3-Attributes:
# Attributes is a method of class is also called class variable which is decleared inside in class outside of method.

# 4-Object:
# Object is a method of real world identity/entity of class, object is a current instence(reference) of your class. Object are usefull to allocate dynamic memory of class. 


# Question-What is the diffrence between function and method.
# Function without object wuthout members is called function and that function call in the class is called method.
# class one():(class)
#     x=10(variable/attributes)
#     y=20
#     def add (self):(method)
#         z=self.x+self.y
#         print(z)
# k=one()(object k is a instence variable)
# k.add()
